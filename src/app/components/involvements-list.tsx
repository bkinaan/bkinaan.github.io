My aim as President was to create a more engaging community and improve fundraising efforts of our chapter. This chapter is the largest in the nation, making up about ten percent of the entire national organization. Since my time as President has begun, there have been successful improvements in member engagement and community building. We have also made overwhelmingly positive strides in fundraising and hit the halfway point on our fundraising goal by the end of the fall semester. This is a goal not obtained by this chapter for five years. I won Chapter President of the Year and we have also won second place for overall Chapter of the Year.",

During the week-of, I led a group of about 12 new students through a series of events and activities that aimed to prepare them not only for further education but also a more independent life away from home.",
